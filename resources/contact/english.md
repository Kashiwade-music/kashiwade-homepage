<b>Info</b>
  <ul>
    <li>If I receive a request and the content is too incomplete, I will decline the request.</li>
    <li>Excessive retakes or corrections will be refused or additional charges may be incurred.</li>
    <li>If you want a little background music for personal use, or if you'd like me to write a song for you more casually, please consider requesting it through <a href="https://skeb.jp/@kashiwade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skeb</a> too.</li>
