<h1 class="contact">Comments, Requests, or Requests to use my works</h1>

Feel free to share your thoughts on Kashiwade's past songs through email, [X(Twitter)](https://twitter.com/Kashiwade_music) DMs, or comments. Your feedback, whether brief or detailed, is highly appreciated and encourages me. Please don't hesitate to reach out!

I also welcome various requests (CD reissues, requests, odai-bako, etc.). While I can't fulfill all requests, feel free to contact me.

For using my previous songs (in games, YouTube, streaming, etc.), please use **email** for contact if possible. Using Twitter DMs or comments might lead to delays.

When contacting me, providing the following would help:
- What is usage?
  - If using the music for various distribution services (YouTube, Twitch, etc...), please share your channel links.
- Commercial / Non-commercial
- Whether the title of my music and composer name will be written or not
  - If you do not display the name of my music and composer, I refuse the use of my music.

<h1 class="contact">Music Production Requests</h1>

I'm accepting requests for music production (composition/arrangement), mixing, and mastering, whether for commercial or fan purposes. If you have a project where I can help, please email me with the following:

- Your name
- URLs to your website, X(Twitter), Facebook account: If available, please provide.
